            Applied PCR to A.victoria jellyfish blue fluorescent protein (BFP) cDNA for site-directed mutagenesis (Y66H). Modification turned BFP to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Performed bacteria transformation, gel electrophoresis (agarose and PAGE), chemiluminescence, and spectrophotometry. Used for cell visualization.
